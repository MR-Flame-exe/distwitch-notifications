```json
{
  "token": "",
  "twitch_token": "",
  "twitch_id": "",
  "twitch_secret": "",
  "CLIENT_ID": ""
}
```

1. The "token" is the token of your discord bot. (If you haven't one, you can create one here: https://discord.com/developers/applications)

2. You can blank it for the moment.

3. In the twitch_id value, you will need to put the id of your twitch application here. (If you haven't one, you can create one here: https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps)

4. In the twitch_secret value, you will need to put the secret of your twitch application. (If you haven't one, you can create one here: https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps)

5. Finally you will need to put the id of your discord bot in the CLIENT_ID value (If you don't know how to get it, simply go on the page of your discord bot and on the "General informations" page, you will find a section "Application id" and then copy it)
